    <p>The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.[12][13] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[14] and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16.[9][15] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[16] Along with the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are the last iPhones to feature the Lightning port, as their successors, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus (announced on September 12, 2023), use a USB-C port instead, per European Commission regulation.</p>
