         <p>The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the seventeenth and current generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were announced on September 12, 2023, during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California alongside the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Pre-orders began on September 15, 2023, and the devices were made available on September 22, 2023. Like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the 15 and 15 Plus replace the proprietary Lightning connector with USB-C to comply with European Union mandates.</p>
